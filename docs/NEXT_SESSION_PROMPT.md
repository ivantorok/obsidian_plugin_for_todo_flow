# Next Session Strategy: Mobile Constraints Audit

## Initial Prompt
Copy and paste this into the next chat session to resume exactly where we left off with the right context:

> I want to perform a Constraints Audit on the mobile experience. Please read the `README.md` and specifically focus on the new Mobile Documentation suite (`docs/MOBILE_UX_GLOSSARY.md`, `docs/MOBILE_INTERACTION_SPEC.md`, `docs/MOBILE_TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md`, and `docs/STRATEGY_LEAN_MOBILE.md`).
>
> Your task: Compare the requirements in the 'Interaction Spec' against the 'Technical Constraints'. Identify the 3 most dangerous 'UX Oxymorons' in our current implementation and propose how we might move them toward the 'Lean Mobile Strategy' to ensure stability on low-end hardware.

## Strategic Summary of Current State
*   **Glossary**: Defined technical vocabulary (Intent Locking, Gesture Shadowing, VKLS).
*   **Constraints**: Identified "invisible walls" (Main Thread bottlenecks, DOM complexity, Input lag).
*   **Interaction Spec**: Mapped every user story and feature to technical interaction patterns.
*   **Lean Strategy**: Proposed the "Elias Model" (Executioner vs. Adaptive Lead) for low-end hardware optimization.
