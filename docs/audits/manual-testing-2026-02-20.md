# Manual Testing Audit: 2026-02-20

## Context & Goal
Strategic review of the current implementation against our defined `JOURNEYS.md` and user personas (Lillian & Elias). 
The goal is to explicitly identify core invariants to **protect** and friction points to **change**.

## 1. Journey: The Desktop "Lillian" Triage
*(Reference: `docs/reference/JOURNEYS.md` - Section 1)*

### 🛡️ Core Mechanics to Protect (Working well)
*   ...

### 🚧 Friction Points & Proposed Changes
*   **Observation:** ...
*   **Systems Impact:** ...
*   **Strategic adjustment:** ...

## 2. Journey: The Mobile "Elias" Execution
*(Reference: `docs/reference/JOURNEYS.md` - Section 2)*

### 🛡️ Core Mechanics to Protect
*   ...

### 🚧 Friction Points & Proposed Changes
*   **Observation:** ...
*   **Systems Impact:** ...
*   **Strategic adjustment:** ...

## 3. Systemic / Persistence Observations
*(For things happening beneath the user journeys, like file syncing, background watchers, or error recovery)*
