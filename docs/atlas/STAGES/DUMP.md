# Stage: Dump

The rapid-entry phase where raw thoughts are captured before any processing occurs.

## Characteristics
- **Input Type**: Multi-line text or rapid single-line entry.
- **Target**: New files or appends to a "Mobile Inbox".
- **Mechanics Applied**:
    - `[[VIEWPORT_SOVEREIGNTY]]`: Ensures the "Done" trigger and input remain visible over the keyboard.
    - `[[FOCUS_HANDSHAKE]]`: Immediate focus on mount.

## Transitions
- **Completion**: Typing `done` or clicking "Finish" triggers the transition to `[[TRIAGE]]`.
- **Handoff**: Must be atomic to prevent "Host Leak" (flashing of Obsidian background).
