## 1. The "Where did my keyboard go?" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Focus Sovereignty & Escape to Home*
> **The User:** "I was just adding a quick task to my list using the 'Quick Add' popup. I finished typing, hit 'Enter' to save it, and the popup closed. I immediately tried to use my arrow keys to move down to the next task, but nothing happened! I had to take my hand off the keyboard, grab the mouse, and click on the list just to tell the computer I wanted to use my keys again. It felt like the app 'forgot' I was there."

## 2. The "I'm typing, not jumping!" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Input Neutrality & Deterministic Exception*
> **The User:** "I was trying to rename a task to 'Fix kitchen door'. As soon as I typed the letter **'d'** in 'door', the task suddenly jumped to a 2-hour duration and my cursor disappeared! It turns out the app thought I was pressing a shortcut key for 'duration' instead of just typing a word. I just want the app to know that when I'm in a text box, I'm typing, not giving commands."

## 3. The "Ghostly Sidebar" Story
**Target Axiom:** *80px Threshold & Gesture Shadowing*
> **The User:** "I'm using the app on my phone. Sometimes when I'm just trying to scroll down my list to see what's next, I accidentally swipe a tiny bit to the right. Suddenly, the entire Obsidian sidebar slides out and covers my whole screen! I wasn't trying to open the sidebar; I was just trying to navigate my list. It's way too sensitive."

## 4. The "Hidden Text" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Viewport Shifting*
> **The User:** "I tapped a task at the very bottom of my screen to rename it. The phone's keyboard popped up, but it completely covered the task I was editing! I was typing 'blind' because I couldn't see what I was writing anymore. I had to stop and manually scroll the page up just to see the words I was typing."

## 5. The "Forgotten Pickup" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Input Consistency (TBD)*
> **The User:** "I'm doing my daily triage on my phone. I tap the `+` button to add something to my queue. When I create a *brand new* task, it gets added to the bottom of my triage list perfectly. But sometimes I remember an old task I'd dumped before that I want to tackle today. So I use the same `+` button and *select* that existing task instead of creating a new one. But... nothing happens! The task doesn't show up in my triage queue. It feels like the app heard me say 'add this' for new tasks, but ignores me when I point to an old one."

## 6. The "Sticky Button" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Static Interaction Pattern*
> **The User:** "On my Android phone, when I tap the 'Shortlist' button, it turns blue to show I've pressed it. But then it stays blue! Even after I've moved on to the next task, the button still looks like it's being held down. It's confusing because I don't know if the app is stuck or if I'm still 'pressing' it. I'd rather the button just stay one color and let the task animation show me it worked."

## 7. The "One-Way Street" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Hierarchy Navigation (Go Back)*
> **The User:** "I'm using the app on my phone and I tapped on a task to see its sub-tasks. It opened up a new view perfectly, which is what I wanted. But then I realized I was done and wanted to go back to my main daily list. I looked for a back button, but the one at the top of the screen was greyed out! I felt trapped in that sub-list and had no idea how to get back to my main schedule without closing the whole app."

## 8. The "Double-Covered Input" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Viewport Shifting (Hardened)*
> **The User:** "When I tap a task on my phone to rename it, the keyboard pops up. But it's not just the keyboard—there's also a big empty gray block that appears right above the keyboard. Between the keyboard and that weird empty space, the task I'm actually trying to edit is completely hidden! I can't see the letters I'm typing because they're buried under two layers of 'stuff'."

## 9. The "Runaway Title" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Content Containment*
> **The User:** "Sometimes I have a task with a really long description, like 'Pick up the dry cleaning and then go to the grocery store for milk and eggs'. On my phone, instead of staying inside the card, the text just keeps going and going to the right until it's off the edge of my screen. I can't read the end of my own tasks because they won't stay in their lane!"

## 10. The "Competitive Swiper" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Gesture Shadowing & Event Propagation*
> **The User:** "I'm trying to use the swipes to organize my day. When I swipe a card to the right to mark it finished, it works, but at the exact same time, the phone's left-hand menu slides out! And if I try to drag a card down to reorder it, the phone thinks I'm trying to search for a command and brings up the 'Command Palette'. It's like I'm playing a game of Twister with my phone—it's trying to do two things at once for every single move I make."
