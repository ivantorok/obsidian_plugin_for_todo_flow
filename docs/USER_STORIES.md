## 1. The "Where did my keyboard go?" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Focus Sovereignty & Escape to Home*
> **The User:** "I was just adding a quick task to my list using the 'Quick Add' popup. I finished typing, hit 'Enter' to save it, and the popup closed. I immediately tried to use my arrow keys to move down to the next task, but nothing happened! I had to take my hand off the keyboard, grab the mouse, and click on the list just to tell the computer I wanted to use my keys again. It felt like the app 'forgot' I was there."

## 2. The "I'm typing, not jumping!" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Input Neutrality & Deterministic Exception*
> **The User:** "I was trying to rename a task to 'Fix kitchen door'. As soon as I typed the letter **'d'** in 'door', the task suddenly jumped to a 2-hour duration and my cursor disappeared! It turns out the app thought I was pressing a shortcut key for 'duration' instead of just typing a word. I just want the app to know that when I'm in a text box, I'm typing, not giving commands."

## 3. The "Ghostly Sidebar" Story
**Target Axiom:** *80px Threshold & Gesture Shadowing*
> **The User:** "I'm using the app on my phone. Sometimes when I'm just trying to scroll down my list to see what's next, I accidentally swipe a tiny bit to the right. Suddenly, the entire Obsidian sidebar slides out and covers my whole screen! I wasn't trying to open the sidebar; I was just trying to navigate my list. It's way too sensitive."

## 4. The "Hidden Text" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Viewport Shifting*
> **The User:** "I tapped a task at the very bottom of my screen to rename it. The phone's keyboard popped up, but it completely covered the task I was editing! I was typing 'blind' because I couldn't see what I was writing anymore. I had to stop and manually scroll the page up just to see the words I was typing."
