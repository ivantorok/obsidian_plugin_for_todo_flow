# Synthetic Stories: Phase 4 - Optimization & Refinement

## 12. The "Fragile Add" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Input Consistency & Optimistic Sovereignty*
> **The User:** "I'm in the zone, rapidly dumping tasks into my triage. I hit 'Enter' on a task, it appears in my list, and I immediately swipe it to 'Done' or 'Archive' because it's a quick win. But as soon as I swipe, the app throws an error or the task just disappears into thin air! It's like the app is lagging behind my fingers—it shows me the task exists, but isn't actually ready to be touched yet. I shouldn't have to wait for the spinning wheel to finish before I can organize my day."

## 13. The "Hot Phone" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Lean Mobile & Zero-Logic Rendering*
> **The User:** "I'm using the app in 'Focus Mode' on my phone, just working through my tasks one by one. But after only 15 minutes, my phone is getting noticeably hot and the battery is draining faster than when I'm playing a 3D game! I'm just looking at simple text on a screen—what is the app doing in the background that's making my phone work so hard? It feels like it's trying to run a heavy desktop computer engine inside a tiny phone frame."

## 14. The "Competitive Background" Story
**Target Axiom:** *Interaction Sovereignty & Law of One Source*
> **The User:** "I'm working on my tasks when Obsidian Sync decides it's time to update my files in the background. Suddenly, my screen flashes, my task list reloads, and I lose my spot. Even if Sync is updating a completely different note I'm not even looking at, the app seems to panic and force a full reload of my current stack. I want the app to stay quiet and focused on what I'm doing right now, and only listen to background changes when I'm actually idle."
