# Release Notes - v1.2.76

## Summary
This release focuses on hardening the "Quick Add" workflow and resolving race conditions identified during architectural audits. We have implemented interaction locks and unified guards across all views to ensure a stable user experience during rapid actions.

## Key Changes
- **Quick Add Consistency (BUG-022)**: Unified guards across `StackController`, `ArchitectStack`, `StackView`, and `TriageView` to prevent interactions with temporary tasks until they are fully persisted.
- **Race Condition Hardening (BUG-023)**: Implemented interaction tokens (`claimLock`/`releaseLock`) in `StackPersistenceService` to protect UI state during asynchronous file operations.
- **Sovereign Silence Optimization**: Refined persistence flushing to ensure immediate synchronization of resolved IDs without triggering redundant UI updates.

## Technical Details
- **Interaction Tokens**: Added explicit locking mechanism for high-stakes UI gestures.
- **Optimistic UI Guards**: Disabled interactive elements (buttons, inputs, gestures) for tasks with `temp-` prefixes.
- **Verification**: Verified stability across the full unit test suite and targeted E2E journeys.
