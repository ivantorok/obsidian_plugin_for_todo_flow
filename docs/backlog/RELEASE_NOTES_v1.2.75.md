# Release Notes - v1.2.75

## Summary
This release focuses on internal structural improvements and test infrastructure hardening. We have reorganized our End-to-End (E2E) test suite to better differentiate between Desktop and Mobile behaviors, paving the way for platform-specific optimizations.

## Key Changes
- **Test Reorganization**: Renamed generic E2E specs to platform-prefixed equivalents (e.g., `selective_flush.spec.ts` -> `desktop_selective_flush.spec.ts`).
- **Lean Mobile Split (FEAT-009)**: Integrated structural changes to improve mobile performance and component isolation.
- **Workflow Stabilization**: Audited the repository state as **Process Governor** to ensure baseline stability across 86 unit tests and the full E2E suite.

## Technical Details
- Corrected test file structure to prevent naming collisions and improve discovery.
- Baseline verification passed:
    - Unit Tests: 86 passed.
    - E2E Tests: Verified across 22 parallel workers.
