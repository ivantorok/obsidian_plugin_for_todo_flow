## Expected Behavior
What should happen? This will be used to write the failing test case.

## Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs)
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...

## Proposed Test Case (TDD)
- [ ] Unit Test: [e.g. should correctly parse X even if Y is missing]
- [ ] E2E Test: [e.g. should show error toast when Z occurs]

## Reuse & Architectural Alignment
Agents MUST identify existing utilities or patterns to reuse to prevent logic drift.
- **Utilities to Reuse**: [e.g. `TaskQueryService`, `FileLogger`]
- **Architectural Patterns**: [e.g. Reactive Projection, Handshake Pattern]

## UX Governance Compliance
- **Rule Alignment**: Which rules from [UX_GOVERNANCE.md](../UX_GOVERNANCE.md) apply to this change? (e.g. Focus Sovereignty, 80px Swipe Threshold).
